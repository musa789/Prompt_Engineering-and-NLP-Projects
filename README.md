Fine-tuning GPT-2 for Text Generation
This code fine-tunes a pre-trained GPT-2 model for text generation using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is trained on a custom text corpus and can generate new text based on a given prompt.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
PyTorch
Transformers
Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code
Install PyTorch and Transformers using pip or conda:
Copy code
pip install torch
pip install transformers
Usage
Create a new text file data.txt in the same directory as the script.
Add your text corpus to the data.txt file.
Open the gpt2-finetuning.py script and set the desired parameters, such as the number of training epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python gpt2-finetuning.py
After training, the fine-tuned model will be saved to the ./model directory.
To generate new text, open the gpt2-generation.py script and modify the prompt variable to your desired text prompt.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python gpt2-generation.py
Criteria
The data.txt file should contain a plain text corpus with one sentence per line.
The gpt2-finetuning.py script should include hyperparameters such as the number of training epochs, batch size, and learning rate, which can be modified by the user.
The gpt2-generation.py script should include a prompt variable that can be modified by the user to generate new text based on a given prompt.
The trained model should be saved to the ./model directory after training.
The README file should include detailed instructions on how to use the code and any necessary requirements or installation steps.

Fine-tuning GPT-2 for Text Generation
This repository contains the code for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model on a custom dataset for text generation using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Requirements
Python 3
PyTorch
Transformers library by Hugging Face
Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Create a data.txt file in the root directory with your desired text for training.
Run python fine_tune_gpt.py to start the training process.
Parameters
You can modify the training parameters in the fine_tune_gpt.py script to adjust the model's performance. Here are some of the key parameters:

num_train_epochs: The number of epochs to train the model for. Default is 1.
batch_size: The batch size for training the model. Default is 1.
max_seq_length: The maximum length of the input sequences. Default is 1024.
learning_rate: The learning rate for training the model. Default is 5e-5.
Output
The model will generate a new text sample after every specified interval and save it to the output.txt file. You can modify the interval by adjusting the logging_steps parameter in the fine_tune_gpt.py script.
